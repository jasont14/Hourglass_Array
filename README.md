# Hourglass_Array
2D Array Challenge to calculate max value of array values that fit Hourglass.

CHALLENGE - HourGlass Array

    Given a  2D Array, :

        1 1 1 0 0 0
        0 1 0 0 0 0
        1 1 1 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0

        We define an hourglass in  to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:

            a b c
              d
            e f g

        There are hourglasses in , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

    Task
        
        Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum.


    Input Format

        There are  lines of input, where each line contains  space-separated integers describing 2D Array ; every value in will be in the inclusive range of  to.

    Constraints

        -9 <= A[i][j] <= 9
         0 <= i,j <= 6

    Output Format

        Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in .
